At Omaha Code School, we strive to be a positive voice in today's technology industry. Our goal is to make our corner of this community a welcoming, inclusive space for anyone and everyone who wants to code.

# Code of Conduct

To promote this spirit of inclusivity, we ask that our instructors, students, mentors, and guests follow a few basic principles in our space â€“ online, in the classroom, and at our events. These include but are not limited to:

- **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**
- **Be considerate.** Your work and decisions will affect others. Whether writing code, delivering a lecture, or participating in a panel discussion, your actions will have consequences. You should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- **Be respectful.** We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into aggression towards another. Give yourself grace if you feel frustrated with another member of our community or with yourself (because coding is hard work and can be exasperating).
- **Be mindful of vocabulary.** Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Be kind to others, and do not insult or put down another person. Thoughtfulness often means reevaluating what we consider permissible.


## Reporting Inappropriate Behavior

Omaha Code School is meant to be a safe, inclusive space. That includes our physical classroom, anywhere we go for an event, and all of our online realms. Please approach either Rahul, Sumeet, or Chris if you've experienced anything less than that. In return, we promise:

- **To take all harassment reports seriously.**
- **To respect your privacy.**
- **To remove the source of harassment.** This begins with a warning to the offender,  followed by physically removing them from the area if harassment continues.

You can reach us in person, via HipChat (including private messaging), and via the contact information listed below:
